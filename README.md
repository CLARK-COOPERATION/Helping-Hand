## Login Page

The login page of our mental health app utilizes Firebase's authentication system for user login, requiring them to enter their email and password. Test data provided above can be used for easy testing purposes.

## Home Page

The home page has two main functions. It allows users to manage mood swings, and the "feelings" tab enables users to track the reasons behind their mood swings.

User data privacy is a top priority in this application. To ensure data security, we use AES encryption, which means that only the user can read their data.

## Activity Page

The mental health of a user can be tracked by two major factors: their food and sleep routine. This data is displayed again in the Progress Page, where users can view their progress. To help track this information, we have a short quiz for users to input how long they slept the previous day and how much food they ate. Once completed, we provide users with meditation tips to help them maintain their inner self.

## Journal Pages

Our mental health app includes a journal feature that allows users to privately and securely reflect on their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. With our app, users can maintain a personal diary where they can record their innermost feelings in a confidential manner. We recognize the importance of privacy and security, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like mental health. Therefore, we have implemented strong measures to protect user data by encrypting it with the AES algorithm and storing it in a secure Firebase database. You can trust that our app is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure.
